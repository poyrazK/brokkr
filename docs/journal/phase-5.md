# Phase 5 — Consensus & HA

- **Status:** in progress
- **Plan:** `docs/plan.md` §17
- **Started:** 2026-07-02

Goal: replace the single-node embedded metadata store with a **from-scratch
Raft** implementation (CLAUDE.md rule 10 — no external Raft crate), then stand
up a highly-available control plane on top of it. This is the educational
centerpiece of the project. This journal accumulates a short retrospective per
increment.

**Definition of done** (`docs/plan.md` §17): kill the leader → new leader in
< 2 s; partition the cluster → minority stops accepting writes, rejoin →
consistent; 1M operations under fault injection with zero divergence.

**Milestone map** (one PR each, in order): I0 paper notes · I1 ADR 0013 +
`brokkr-raft` scaffold · I2 persistent state on redb · I3 leader election ·
I4 log replication + Figure-8 test · I5 turmoil simulation suite · I6 snapshots
+ InstallSnapshot · I7 joint-consensus membership · I8 Raft-backed KV in
`brokkr-control` + leader redirect · I9 3-node HA + Jepsen-style harness ·
I10 wrap-up + §11 exit-criteria review.

## I0 — Raft paper notes (§17 task 1)

- **Date:** 2026-07-02
- **Affected:** docs only (`docs/raft-notes.md`).
- **Outcome:** `docs/raft-notes.md` — the implementation reference for
  `brokkr-raft`, taken from the extended Raft paper (Ongaro & Ousterhout, 2014)
  and the relevant thesis chapters. Covers the three server states and terms as
  a logical clock; the persistent (`currentTerm`, `votedFor`, `log`) vs. volatile
  state split and the **persist-before-respond** rule; leader election with
  randomized 150–300 ms timeouts; the RequestVote and AppendEntries RPCs step by
  step; the `(lastLogTerm, lastLogIndex)` election restriction; log repair via
  `nextIndex` back-off with conflict-only truncation; snapshots + InstallSnapshot;
  joint-consensus membership; client linearizability with a dedup session cache;
  and the five safety properties.

### Decisions / notes

- **The Figure-8 rule gets top billing (§7 of the notes).** The naive
  "committed once on a majority" rule is unsafe for entries from prior terms;
  the leader commit-advance must gate on `log[N].term == currentTerm`. This is
  the one subtlety most likely to pass casual testing and silently lose data, so
  the notes pin a **deterministic Figure-8 regression test** as a hard
  requirement for milestone I4.
- **Determinism is designed in from I0.** The notes require an **injected clock
  and injected seeded RNG** in the state machine (no `SystemTime::now()`),
  matching `docs/plan.md` §21, so the `turmoil` simulation suite (I5) is
  reproducible from a fixed seed.
- **redb reuse is already blessed.** ADR 0003 anticipated this phase: "the
  snapshot format becomes the redb file at log index N." I6's snapshot design
  will build on that rather than invent a new on-disk format.
- **Everything traces to a milestone.** The notes end with an implementation
  checklist keyed to I1–I9 and a DoD-to-mechanism table, so each later increment
  has an unambiguous spec to test against.

### Next

- **I1:** ADR 0013 (Raft design — transport, log schema, newtypes) for owner
  sign-off, then scaffold the `brokkr-raft` crate (Transport trait + tonic &
  turmoil impls, redb log schema, `Term`/`LogIndex`/`NodeId` newtypes). The ADR
  needs explicit owner approval **before** any implementation.

## I1 — ADR 0013 + `brokkr-raft` scaffold (§17 task 2)

- **Date:** 2026-07-02
- **Affected:** new `crates/brokkr-raft`; `crates/brokkr-proto` (new
  `raft.proto`); workspace `Cargo.toml` (member + `turmoil` dev-dep).
- **Outcome:** the from-scratch Raft crate's foundation is in place — the pieces
  the consensus state machine (I3–I4) is built on, each with tests in the same
  commit. Owner signed off on the four ADR 0013 decisions via `AskUserQuestion`
  before any code was written.

### Decisions (ADR 0013, all owner-approved)

- **D1 redb schema:** two tables in one `raft.redb`/node — `log` (`u64` index →
  protobuf-encoded `LogEntry`) and `meta` (`&str` → hard state). Entries are
  stored in the same protobuf they take on the wire, so a leader replicates
  stored bytes without re-encoding. `commitIndex`/`lastApplied` stay volatile.
- **D2 transport:** a dedicated `brokkr/v1/raft.proto` (`RaftService`) plus an
  async `Transport` trait. Ships `TonicTransport` (production gRPC) and
  `InMemoryTransport` (deterministic, socket-free) — the latter is the substrate
  for the I2–I4 consensus tests. The tonic-over-`turmoil` fault-injection path is
  I5, once a running node exists to serve; ADR 0013 scopes it there.
- **D3 randomness:** a hand-rolled seeded SplitMix64 PRNG (`rng::Rng`) — **no new
  dependency**, fully reproducible under simulation.
- **D4 concurrency:** a single-task actor / `tokio::select!` event loop
  (documented for I3; no locks on Raft state).

### Notes

- **Persist-before-respond is designed in, proven in I2.** Every `RaftLog`
  mutator commits its redb transaction before returning. The rigorous
  crash-consistency tests and the wiring into the node's reply path are I2; this
  milestone lands the schema and primitives with round-trip + reopen-persistence
  tests.
- **`turmoil` is exercised, not just declared.** An integration test frames
  `brokkr-raft`'s real wire types (protobuf `RequestVote`/reply) over turmoil's
  simulated TCP and asserts a reproducible outcome — so the dev-dep earns its
  place and the I5 suite has a working substrate.
- **Conflict fast-backtrack hint reserved on the wire now.** `AppendEntriesReply`
  carries `conflict_term`/`conflict_index` from the start (cheap to add to the
  proto, used by the I4 log-repair optimization) so we never need a wire change
  for it later.
- **Verified per-crate in WSL2:** `brokkr-raft` is green on `fmt --check`,
  `clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings`, 29 unit + 2 turmoil integration tests, and
  `RUSTDOCFLAGS=-Dwarnings cargo doc`. `brokkr-proto` and the downstream
  `brokkr-control` still compile with the added proto.

### TODOs

- I5: wire the tonic stack over `turmoil` (custom connector + `serve_with_incoming`)
  for partition/delay/reorder fault injection.

### Next

- **I2:** persistent state on redb with the strict persist-before-respond
  discipline and crash tests (kill mid-write, assert no torn vote / consistent
  `(currentTerm, votedFor, log)` on recovery).

## I2 — persistent state + crash consistency (§17 task 2)

- **Date:** 2026-07-03
- **Affected:** `crates/brokkr-raft` (`state.rs` new; `storage.rs`).
- **Outcome:** the Raft hard state is now crash-safe. `HardState`
  (`currentTerm` + `votedFor`) is written **atomically as a unit** through
  `RaftLog::save_hard_state` (one redb transaction), and crash-consistency is
  proven by tests rather than assumed.

### Decisions / notes

- **The torn-vote hazard is the whole point of I2.** I1 wrote `currentTerm` and
  `votedFor` in *separate* transactions. A crash between "bump term to T" and
  "clear vote" could recover as `(T, old-candidate)` — a vote cast in a term the
  node never legitimately voted in, which can produce **two leaders in one term**
  (Election Safety violation, `docs/raft-notes.md` §3, §8). I2 collapses the two
  writes into one atomic commit via `HardState`, so that intermediate state is
  unreachable. `HardState::stepped_to(term)` encodes the "advance term ⇒ clear
  vote" transition in the value itself.
- **Persist-before-respond is now tested two ways.**
  - *Uncommitted writes are invisible* (`uncommitted_write_is_invisible_after_reopen`):
    a write that is begun but never committed (the crash-before-fsync case) leaves
    no trace after reopen — redb rolls it back. This is the deterministic proof of
    the safety model.
  - *Committed writes survive a real crash* (`tests/crash_consistency.rs`): the
    test re-execs its own binary as a child that commits a hard state and then
    calls `std::process::abort()` (a stand-in for power loss). The parent reopens
    and asserts the committed state is intact and uncorrupted.
- **API simplified, not just extended.** `set_current_term` / `set_voted_for`
  were removed (they made the non-atomic hazard *easy to write*); the only way to
  persist hard state now is the atomic `save_hard_state`. `commitIndex` /
  `lastApplied` remain volatile by design (recomputed on restart).
- **Atomic *read*, too (Copilot review catch).** The write is atomic, but the
  first cut of `load_hard_state` composed `current_term()` and `voted_for()` —
  two separate read transactions, so a concurrent `save_hard_state` could
  interleave and hand back a `(term, vote)` pair that was never committed
  together. Fixed to read both keys in one read transaction; a concurrent
  writer/reader stress test (`load_hard_state_reads_a_consistent_pair_under_concurrent_writes`)
  guards it. Also added a `debug_assert` in `HardState::stepped_to` enforcing the
  monotonic-term invariant.

### Verified per-crate in WSL2

`brokkr-raft` green on `fmt --check`, `clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings`,
**37 unit + 4 integration** tests (incl. the subprocess crash test), and
`RUSTDOCFLAGS=-Dwarnings cargo doc`.

### Next

- **I3:** leader election — `RequestVote` handler, the `(lastLogTerm,
  lastLogIndex)` up-to-date comparator (election restriction), randomized
  election timeouts with an **injected clock + seeded RNG**, and the "higher term
  ⇒ step down + clear vote" pre-check wired onto `save_hard_state`. Node logic
  tested against `InMemoryTransport`.

## I3 — leader election (§17 task 2)

- **Date:** 2026-07-03
- **Affected:** `crates/brokkr-raft` (`node.rs` new).
- **Outcome:** the `RaftNode` consensus state machine now elects leaders. It
  implements `RequestVote` (persist-before-respond), the election restriction,
  randomized timeouts, the universal higher-term step-down, majority vote
  counting, and heartbeat-driven election suppression — all proven with eight
  deterministic tests, including a **2–2 split vote resolving in the next term**.

### Decisions / notes

- **Functional core, imperative shell — the key testability decision.** ADR 0013
  D4 mandates a single-task actor with no locks. Rather than build the async
  event loop first (hard to test deterministically without turmoil), I factored
  the node into a **synchronous, single-owner state machine**: `tick(now)` drives
  time and `handle_*(req, now)` drive RPCs, each *returning* the messages to send
  rather than performing I/O. This is the etcd/tikv-style "Ready" pattern. It
  does not contradict D4 — the actor loop (I5) will own exactly this state and
  call these methods — but it lets the tests drive whole clusters by hand with an
  **injected clock + seeded RNG**, no async runtime, fully reproducible. The
  async shell (wiring to `Transport` + a real timer) lands with the simulation
  suite (I5) where simulated time can exercise it.
- **The election restriction is one line, and it's a total order.** "Candidate is
  at least as up-to-date" reduces to `(cand_last_term, cand_last_index) >=
  (our_last_term, our_last_index)` via tuple ordering (§6). Tested across all five
  cases (higher term wins; equal-and-equal grants; equal-term-longer wins;
  equal-term-shorter denies; lower-term denies even if longer).
- **Persist-before-respond, enforced through `save_hard_state`.** Every path that
  changes term or vote — `observe_term` (step down), `start_election` (bump +
  self-vote), granting a vote — writes the atomic `HardState` from I2 *before*
  returning the reply. `observe_term` is the single choke point for the
  "higher term ⇒ follower + clear vote" rule, called at the top of every handler.
- **Heartbeats are the minimal AppendEntries for I3.** A new leader emits empty
  `AppendEntries`; followers reset their election timers on receipt, which is what
  keeps a stable leader from being unseated. The log-consistency check, conflict
  truncation, entry append, commit advance, and the no-op-on-election are all
  explicitly deferred to I4 (marked `TODO(I4)` in `handle_append_entries`).
- **Split-vote test is the proof that randomized timeouts work.** Four nodes,
  two candidates in term 1 splitting the vote 2–2 (no majority); then the
  earliest-expiring node re-campaigns in term 2 and wins. This is exactly the
  §4.1 mechanism, made deterministic by seeding the per-node RNG.

### Verified per-crate in WSL2

`brokkr-raft` green on `fmt --check`, `clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings`,
**47 unit + 4 integration** tests, and `RUSTDOCFLAGS=-Dwarnings cargo doc`.

### Next

- **I4:** log replication — `AppendEntries` consistency check (steps 2–5,
  `docs/raft-notes.md` §5.1), `nextIndex`/`matchIndex` with conflict back-off,
  the leader commit rule gated on `log[N].term == currentTerm`, the start-of-term
  no-op entry, and the mandatory **Figure-8 regression test** (§7).

## I4 — log replication + the Figure-8 rule (§17 task 2)

- **Date:** 2026-07-04
- **Affected:** `crates/brokkr-raft` (`node.rs`, `storage.rs`, `transport.rs`,
  `error.rs`); `crates/brokkr-proto` (additive `match_index` field on
  `AppendEntriesReply`).
- **Outcome:** leaders now replicate their log and advance the commit index
  **safely** — the Figure-8 current-term commit rule is implemented and proven by
  a regression test. This is the safety centerpiece of the whole phase.

### Decisions / notes

- **The current-term commit gate is the one line that matters.**
  `advance_commit_index` walks candidate indices top-down and commits the largest
  `N` that a majority holds **and** whose `log[N].term == currentTerm`. Without
  that second clause a leader would commit a prior-term entry the moment it sits
  on a majority — exactly the Figure-8 data-loss bug. The
  `figure_8_prior_term_entry_not_committed_by_replica_count` test reproduces the
  hazard end-to-end: n0 (term 1) puts entry A on the majority `{n0,n1}` without
  learning it (so A is uncommitted); n1 then wins term 2 and *re-replicates* A (a
  term-1 entry) to the whole cluster; the test asserts `commit_index == 0` at
  that point — A is on a majority but must not commit — and only after n1
  proposes a term-2 entry B that reaches a majority does commit jump to 2,
  sweeping A in indirectly. Remove the current-term clause and this test fails.
- **Conflict-only truncation, never blind truncation.** `append_new_entries`
  keeps any incoming entry we already store at the same term and truncates *only*
  on a genuine term conflict, then appends the rest. A dedicated test
  (`idempotent_append_does_not_truncate_a_matching_suffix`) guards against the
  classic "truncate to prev_log_index then append" bug that a delayed/duplicated
  `AppendEntries` would otherwise use to erase a committed suffix.
- **`matchIndex` reported in the reply, not inferred.** Rather than have the
  leader remember what it sent (fragile under async), the follower reports, on
  success, the highest index it now matches (`prev_log_index + entries.len()`) via
  a new `AppendEntriesReply.match_index` field. The leader sets
  `matchIndex[peer]` from it — correct in both the synchronous test harness and
  the future async driver.
- **Back-off converges via the follower's conflict hint.** On a failed check the
  follower returns the first index of the conflicting term (or `last+1` if its
  log is too short); the leader jumps `nextIndex` there and retries. The
  `lagging_follower_catches_up_via_backoff` test drives an empty follower to a
  three-entry log through this loop.
- **Start-of-term no-op deferred, deliberately.** Raft recommends appending a
  no-op on election so the leader can commit and learn its commit index sooner
  (and to make lease-free reads safe). It is a read-safety / latency
  optimization, **not** required for replication safety, and including it would
  force the Figure-8 test to catch a transient rather than a clean state. It is
  deferred to the linearizable-read work (I8); `become_leader` documents this.

### Verified per-crate in WSL2

`brokkr-raft` green on `fmt --check`, `clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings`,
**56 unit + 4 integration** tests, and `RUSTDOCFLAGS=-Dwarnings cargo doc`.
`brokkr-proto` and the downstream `brokkr-control` compile with the additive
proto field.

### Next

- **I5:** the `turmoil` simulation suite — the **async event-loop shell** that
  wires `RaftNode` to a `Transport` and a real timer, then the tonic-over-turmoil
  transport, driving partitions / message reorder / crash-mid-write against a
  running cluster with a **linearizability** oracle over committed entries.

## I5a — deterministic fault-injection simulator (§17 task 3)

- **Date:** 2026-07-04
- **Affected:** `crates/brokkr-raft` (`tests/simulation.rs`, new).
- **Owner decision:** asked how to build I5 (plan says "turmoil", but
  `RaftNode`'s `std::time` clock doesn't advance under turmoil). Owner chose
  **both** a deterministic simulator *and* the full turmoil async driver, with
  **tonic-over-turmoil** as the transport. I split I5 into **I5a** (this: the
  deterministic simulator — highest safety value, lowest risk, no clock/async
  refactor) and **I5b** (next: the async `RaftDriver` + clock abstraction +
  tonic-over-turmoil).
- **Outcome:** a seeded, in-process discrete-event simulator drives a cluster of
  synchronous `RaftNode`s through message latency/reorder/loss, partitions, and
  crash/restart, and a linearizability oracle proves **State Machine Safety**
  after every step. Five scenarios pass, headlined by a 60-round soak that
  interleaves writes with random faults and never diverges.

### Decisions / notes

- **Why a deterministic simulator, not (only) turmoil.** turmoil runs real async
  code over a simulated network, which is realism I5b will add — but for the
  *safety* oracle, a hand-rolled discrete-event scheduler is both more
  controllable (I can script an exact partition or crash instant) and more
  reproducible (one seed fixes latency, reorder, and the fault sequence), and it
  drives the existing synchronous `RaftNode` **with no clock or async refactor**.
  It reuses the node's `tick`/`handle_*`/`propose` return-the-messages design
  directly.
- **The oracle is committed-prefix agreement.** `assert_no_divergence` checks, for
  every pair of live nodes, that the shorter committed log is a prefix of the
  longer — i.e. no committed index ever holds different commands on two nodes
  (State Machine Safety, `docs/raft-notes.md` §8). It is asserted after *every*
  round of the soak, not just at the end, so a transient divergence cannot slip
  through.
- **Crash = drop volatile, keep disk.** `crash(i)` drops the `RaftNode` (closing
  its redb file) but keeps the temp path; `restart(i)` reopens the *same* file,
  so `currentTerm`/`votedFor`/`log` survive and `commitIndex` is recovered by
  replication — exactly the real crash-recovery contract from I2, now exercised
  under a live cluster.
- **Partitions drop, they don't buffer.** A message between two nodes in
  different partition groups is silently lost at delivery; healing lets *new*
  messages flow. This models a clean network partition and lets the minority side
  demonstrably fail to commit.

`brokkr-raft` green on `fmt --check`, `clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings`,
**56 unit + 9 integration** tests (5 new simulation scenarios), and
`RUSTDOCFLAGS=-Dwarnings cargo doc`.

### Next

- **I5b:** the async `RaftDriver` (a `RaftNode` in a tokio task, timer-driven
  `tick`, inbound RPCs over a channel, outbound via a `Transport`), tested on a
  simulated clock. *(As it turned out, the "clock abstraction" was a one-liner —
  `tokio::time::Instant::now().into_std()` — and the real tonic-over-turmoil
  transport was split off into **I5c**; see the I5b entry below.)*

## I5b — async RaftDriver (event-loop shell) (§17 task 3)

- **Date:** 2026-07-06
- **Affected:** `crates/brokkr-raft` (`driver.rs` new, `tests/driver.rs` new,
  `lib.rs`, `Cargo.toml` dev-deps).
- **Outcome:** the synchronous `RaftNode` now runs as a real async task. The
  `RaftDriver` is the imperative shell — one `tokio::select!` loop, no locks —
  and it works end-to-end on a real async runtime, proven deterministically on
  `tokio`'s paused clock (election + commit + minority-partition + heal).

### Decisions / notes

- **Clock: `tokio::time::Instant::now().into_std()`.** `RaftNode.tick`/`handle_*`
  take `now: std::time::Instant`, and the driver sources it from `tokio::time`.
  Under `tokio::time::pause()` (and under `turmoil`) that follows the *simulated*
  clock, so no `Clock` trait or `RaftNode` refactor was needed — the abstraction
  the owner worried about turned out to be a one-liner. The tests advance the
  paused clock in small steps, yielding between them so async message round-trips
  progress; timing is fully reproducible.
- **One writer, no locks.** The node lives inside the select loop; inbound RPCs,
  proposals, tick, and replies-to-our-RPCs are the four arms. Outbounds are sent
  on detached tasks that funnel the peer's reply back into the loop via an
  unbounded channel — so the node is mutated from exactly one place (ADR 0013 D4
  honored at the async layer).
- **`RaftHandle` is both server sink and client.** It implements `RaftRpc`
  (a tonic/`turmoil` server forwards peer RPCs straight to the node) and exposes
  `propose`/`status`. This is what the tonic-over-turmoil server side will wrap.
- **tonic-over-turmoil needs new dependencies — a STOP-AND-ASK.** tonic 0.12 runs
  on hyper 1.0, so bridging `turmoil::net::TcpStream` into tonic's client
  connector and server `serve_with_incoming` requires `hyper-util` (`TokioIo`)
  and probably `tower`/`http-body-util` as **new dev-dependencies**. Per the
  hard "any dep beyond `turmoil` = stop and ask" rule, this milestone ships the
  driver (tested on the paused clock + an in-process transport) and defers the
  real tonic-over-turmoil integration until the owner approves those deps (or
  chooses framed-protobuf-over-turmoil, which needs none and is proven in
  `tests/turmoil_wire.rs`).

### Next

- **I5c:** the real **tonic-over-turmoil** transport + a `turmoil` multi-node
  cluster test — pending the dependency decision above.

## I5c — tonic-over-turmoil cluster tests (§17 task 3)

- **Date:** 2026-07-08
- **Affected:** `crates/brokkr-raft` (`tests/turmoil_cluster.rs` new, `lib.rs`
  re-export, `Cargo.toml` dev-deps), workspace `Cargo.toml` + `Cargo.lock`.
- **Outcome:** the gap I5b left open is closed. A real 3-node cluster —
  `RaftDriver`s over the **production `TonicTransport`** — runs with every
  Raft RPC crossing `turmoil`'s simulated network as genuine gRPC/HTTP2.
  Election, replicated commit, a minority-partitioned leader that cannot
  commit, failover to a higher-term leader, and post-heal convergence
  (step-down + overwrite of the uncommitted minority entry) all hold on the
  real wire.

### Decisions / notes

- **The glue is dev-only, ~60 lines, no production change.** Server side: a
  `TurmoilIo` newtype (delegating `AsyncRead`/`AsyncWrite`, implementing
  tonic's `Connected`) feeds `serve_with_incoming` from a
  `turmoil::net::TcpListener` via an accept-pump into a `ReceiverStream`.
  Client side: `Endpoint::connect_with_connector_lazy` with a
  `tower::service_fn` that opens a `turmoil::net::TcpStream` wrapped in
  `hyper_util::rt::TokioIo` (the same pattern as tonic 0.12's UDS example).
  `TonicTransport` and `RaftServiceAdapter` are used exactly as production
  will use them; `RaftServiceAdapter` is now re-exported from the crate root.
- **HTTP/2 keepalive is load-bearing, not decoration.** First run failed:
  after `turmoil::repair`, the healed cluster never re-integrated the deposed
  leader. Cause: turmoil partitions **drop packets silently** (I5a note), so
  an h2 connection that was alive when the partition started never surfaces a
  socket error — tonic pins the dead connection and every RPC on it just
  times out, forever. `http2_keep_alive_interval` + `keep_alive_timeout` +
  `keep_alive_while_idle` on the peer `Endpoint`s makes hyper declare the
  connection dead, and the lazy channel redials. **Carry this into I9:** the
  production HA control plane's peer channels need the same keepalive
  settings, or a real-world partition heals into the same wedge.
- **Deps trimmed from the approved set.** `http-body-util` turned out
  unnecessary; `brokkr-proto`/`prost`/`tonic` were already regular
  dependencies (visible to integration tests). Net new: `hyper-util`
  (`tokio` feature) + `tower` (`util`) in the workspace, and
  `hyper-util`/`tower`/`tokio-stream` as `brokkr-raft` dev-deps.
- **Observation stays out-of-band.** As in the driver tests, `RaftHandle`s in
  a shared registry are used for `status()`/`propose` — only Raft traffic is
  subject to the simulated network, which is exactly what
  `turmoil::partition`/`repair` manipulate. A client-facing RPC surface is
  I8/I9 scope.

### Next

- **I6:** snapshots / log compaction (plan §17 task 4) — `InstallSnapshot`
  is already stubbed in the wire types and `RaftRpc`; the driver's
  `install_snapshot` handler currently rejects with "not implemented until
  I6".

## I6 — snapshots & log compaction (§17 task 4)

- **Date:** 2026-07-08
- **Affected:** `crates/brokkr-raft` (`types.rs` `SnapshotMeta`, `storage.rs`
  snapshot persistence, `node.rs` compaction + `InstallSnapshot` both sides,
  `driver.rs` routing + `RaftHandle::compact`, `error.rs` `Snapshot` variant,
  `lib.rs`; tests in `storage.rs`, `node.rs`, `tests/driver.rs`,
  `tests/simulation.rs`).
- **Outcome:** the log no longer grows without bound. The committed prefix
  compacts into a snapshot, a leader catches compacted-away followers up via
  single-shot `InstallSnapshot`, and the whole I5 fault campaign is green
  with `snapshot_threshold = 16` (the plan's exit criterion).

### Decisions / notes

- **Atomicity is the whole game (§III.4):** snapshot metadata + blob + the
  covered prefix's removal commit in **one** redb transaction
  (`RaftLog::compact_to`), so no crash point exists where the prefix is gone
  but the snapshot is not. The receiver's "discard the entire log" path
  (`install_snapshot_replacing_log`) is likewise a single transaction.
- **The node stays sans-IO; the blob comes from the caller.**
  `RaftNode::compact(data)` takes the serialized state machine at exactly
  `commit_index`; `needs_snapshot()` is the trigger the shell polls. The plan
  sketched `Effect::SnapshotRequest`, but the implemented architecture returns
  `Outbound`s rather than effects — a poll + explicit `compact` keeps the
  one-writer discipline without inventing a callback plumbed through the
  event loop. I8's KV wires `snapshot()`/`restore()` to it.
- **Last-`(index, term)` must survive full compaction.** After the whole log
  compacts, `RaftLog::last_index_and_term` falls back to the snapshot
  metadata (one read txn), keeping the election restriction and
  `prev_log_term` at the snapshot boundary correct — proven by a vote test
  on a fully compacted voter.
- **Stale-snapshot guard doubles as the P9 floor.** An inbound snapshot at or
  below `commit_index` (or our own snapshot) is ignored, so applied state
  never regresses; on restart `commit_index` starts at the snapshot index.
- **Single-shot only.** `offset != 0 || !done` → `RaftError::Snapshot`;
  chunking is future work (entries are small KV commands). The driver treats
  that as a peer-protocol error — reply dropped, loop keeps running — while
  local storage errors stay fatal.
- **Oracle under compaction:** the sim's snapshot blob is the committed
  command history (length-prefixed), so `committed(i)` = decoded blob + log
  tail. The linearizability oracle is unchanged in spirit but now spans the
  compacted region; a receiver of `InstallSnapshot` contributes the leader's
  blob as its prefix, which is exactly the restore-then-replay restart path.

`brokkr-raft` green on `fmt --check`, `clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings`,
**69 unit + 17 integration** tests (13 new unit; new integration: driver
snapshot catch-up over the switchboard, constant-compaction history
preservation, crashed-follower catch-up via `InstallSnapshot`, and the fault
soak re-run at `snapshot_threshold = 16`), and
`RUSTDOCFLAGS=-Dwarnings cargo doc`.

### Next

- **I7:** membership changes via joint consensus (plan §17 task 5) —
  `EntryPayload::ConfChange`, config applied on append (rolled back on
  truncation, P10), learner catch-up gate, one in-flight change at a time.
  `SnapshotMeta` gains the cluster configuration then.

## I7a — entry payloads & cluster configurations (§17 task 5, groundwork)

- **Date:** 2026-07-08
- **Affected:** `crates/brokkr-proto` (`raft.proto`: `EntryKind`,
  `ClusterConfig`, `LogEntry` fields 4–5), `crates/brokkr-raft` (`types.rs`
  `EntryPayload`/`ClusterConfig` + fallible decode, `transport.rs` entry
  conversion, `lib.rs`; test touch-ups in `node.rs`, `storage.rs`,
  `tests/simulation.rs`).
- **Outcome:** the log can carry configurations. I7 is split like I5 was:
  **I7a** (this) = types + wire/disk encoding + quorum math, no consensus
  behavior change; **I7b** = joint-consensus machinery (config-on-append +
  P10 rollback, dual-majority elections and commits, propose/commit of
  C_old,new → C_new, `SnapshotMeta` gains the config); **I7c** = learners +
  catch-up gate + membership churn in the fault campaign.

### Decisions / notes

- **Backward compatibility is the load-bearing constraint.** `EntryKind`
  rides field 4 with `COMMAND = 0` (the proto3 default), so every entry an
  I6-era node wrote decodes bit-identically as a command — pinned by a test
  that decodes the exact pre-I7 field-1–3 encoding. No migration, no version
  flag.
- **Decode is now fallible.** `From<pb::LogEntry>` became `TryFrom`: an
  unknown kind, a CONFIG entry missing its config, or an invalid node id is
  a `Codec`/`InvalidNodeId` error at the boundary instead of a silently
  mangled entry. `AppendEntries` conversion propagates it.
- **Quorum math is a pure function, tested now.** `ClusterConfig::has_quorum`
  implements §6's rule — strict majority of `voters` AND of `old_voters`
  when joint; learners never count; an empty voter set never has quorum. I7b
  wires it into elections and `advance_commit_index`; landing it first means
  the trickiest arithmetic ships with focused unit tests before any wiring
  can obscure it.
- **The sim oracle ignores non-command payloads** (`LogEntry::command()`
  returns `None` for `Noop`/`Config`): only commands contribute to applied
  history, which is exactly how the I8 state machine will treat them.
- **`Noop` is declared but never produced** — the start-of-term no-op stays
  deferred to the read path (the I4 decision stands); the variant exists so
  the wire format is settled once.

### Verified per-crate in WSL2

`brokkr-proto` and `brokkr-raft` green on `fmt --check`,
`clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings`, tests (**79 unit + 17 integration**;
10 new unit: payload/config round-trips, pre-I7 decode compatibility,
fallible-decode rejections, quorum properties, config-entry disk round-trip),
and `RUSTDOCFLAGS=-Dwarnings cargo doc`.

### Next

- **I7b:** the joint-consensus machinery — track the active config from the
  log (applied on append, rolled back on truncation, P10), replace the fixed
  `peers` set with config-derived replication targets, route elections and
  commits through `has_quorum`, `propose_conf_change` (one in flight;
  C_old,new commits → append C_new; a leader excluded by a committed C_new
  steps down), and `SnapshotMeta` gains the config.

## I7b — joint-consensus membership changes (§17 task 5)

- **Date:** 2026-07-08
- **Affected:** `crates/brokkr-proto` (`InstallSnapshotRequest.config`),
  `crates/brokkr-raft` (`node.rs` `ConfigTracker` + full quorum rewiring +
  `propose_conf_change` + leader stickiness, `types.rs`
  `SnapshotMeta.config` (no longer `Copy`), `storage.rs` snapshot-config
  persistence, `transport.rs` `InstallSnapshot.config`, `driver.rs`
  `propose_conf_change`/`DriverStatus.config`, `error.rs` `ConfChange`).
- **Outcome:** membership is now a property of the log, changed by joint
  consensus exactly per the paper: propose → C_old,new (applied on append,
  dual-majority agreement) → committed → C_new → committed → an excluded
  leader steps down and the remainder carries on.

### Decisions / notes

- **`ConfigTracker` is the P10 mechanism.** Base config (snapshot or
  bootstrap) + every config entry still in the log, ascending. Append pushes,
  truncation drops entries at/after the cut (the rollback), compaction folds
  into the base, and `InstallSnapshot` adopts the carried config. Rebuilt on
  startup by a full log scan (fine at current scale; an index would be an
  optimization, noted for later).
- **The `peers` field is gone.** Replication targets (voters ∪ old voters ∪
  learners − self), vote targets (voters only — learners are never asked),
  election tallies, and `advance_commit_index` all read the active config;
  `has_quorum` filters non-voters, so stray grants can never elect anyone.
- **`advance_commit_index` returns messages now.** A moved commit index can
  demand follow-ups: appending C_new after the joint config commits, or
  stepping down after a committed C_new excludes the leader. `propose` and
  `propose_conf_change` take `now: Instant` because step-down re-arms the
  election timer (same discipline as every other transition).
- **Leader stickiness (thesis §4.2.3) turned out to be REQUIRED, not
  optional.** The driver-level shrink test failed on the first run: after
  C_new committed, the removed server stopped receiving heartbeats, timed
  out repeatedly, and its ever-higher-term `RequestVote`s deposed the
  legitimate leader — the exact disruption §4.2.3 describes. The fix: a
  server that is a leader, or heard from one within `min_election_timeout`,
  disregards `RequestVote` entirely (no term bump, no grant). Liveness is
  preserved because stale leaders still step down via AppendEntries-carried
  terms — pinned by `a_current_leader_ignores_higher_term_request_votes` and
  the contact-goes-stale test. One I3-era test changed expectation
  accordingly.
- **Snapshots carry the config** (plan's `SnapshotMeta.conf`): persisted
  under `snapshot_config`, sent in `InstallSnapshotRequest.config` (field 8),
  adopted by the receiver; restart prefers the snapshot's config over the
  bootstrap peer list. `SnapshotMeta` lost `Copy` — the config is owned.
- **One change in flight.** `propose_conf_change` rejects while the latest
  config is joint or uncommitted, rejects empty/unchanged voter sets, and
  runs entirely leader-side; followers only ever see config *entries*.

### Verified per-crate in WSL2

`brokkr-proto` and `brokkr-raft` green on `fmt --check`,
`clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings`, tests (**87 unit + 18 integration**;
new: P10 append/rollback, add-a-node end-to-end, removed-leader step-down +
re-election, joint-stall without a new-set majority, one-in-flight and input
validation, snapshot-carries-config across restart and `InstallSnapshot`,
leader stickiness ×2, driver conf-change shrink), and
`RUSTDOCFLAGS=-Dwarnings cargo doc`.

### Next

- **I7c:** learners end-to-end — `add_learner`/promotion flow with the
  thesis ch. 4 catch-up gate (a learner joins the voter set only once its
  match index is near the leader's), plus membership churn added to the I5
  fault campaign (the plan's I7 exit criterion).

## I7c — learners & the catch-up gate (§17 task 5, completes I7)

- **Date:** 2026-07-08
- **Affected:** `crates/brokkr-raft` (`node.rs` `new_learner` +
  voters-only-campaign + `propose_add_learner` + the promotion gate,
  `driver.rs` `propose_add_learner`, `Config::catch_up_margin`;
  `tests/simulation.rs` spare slots + churn campaign).
- **Outcome:** the full thesis ch. 4 join flow works — a fresh node enters
  as a non-voting learner, catches up via normal replication (or
  `InstallSnapshot`), and is promoted through joint consensus only once the
  catch-up gate passes. **I7's exit criterion is met**: the fault campaign
  is green with membership churn added to the mix.

### Decisions / notes

- **Only voters campaign.** A node whose active configuration does not name
  it a voter (a learner, or a fully removed server that learned its removal)
  re-arms its election timer and stays quiet. Complements I7b's leader
  stickiness: stickiness protects the cluster from disruptors; this stops
  well-behaved non-voters from becoming disruptors at all.
- **`new_learner` is how nodes join.** Its bootstrap config lists the
  founding voters and itself only as a learner, so a joining node can never
  self-elect off its bootstrap before learning the real membership. The sim
  spawns spares this way; I9's real join flow should too.
- **The gate measures replication distance, not learner status.** A
  promotion is refused iff an added voter's `matchIndex` lags the leader's
  last index by more than `catch_up_margin` (default 256). Adding a voter
  directly to a small/fresh cluster still works (I7b's add-node test is
  unchanged); adding a cold node to a long log is refused with an error
  pointing at the learner flow.
- **Learner additions are single-config entries.** They change no quorum,
  so joint consensus would be ceremony; the one-in-flight rule still
  applies. Promotion (a quorum change) goes through the full
  C_old,new → C_new machinery from I7b, which drops the promoted node from
  `learners` as it enters `voters`.
- **Churn campaign** (`soak_random_faults_with_membership_churn`): 5
  founders + 2 spare slots, threshold 16, 120 rounds of random
  partitions/crashes/restarts interleaved with a retried churn plan
  (add n5 → promote n5 → retire a founder → add n6 → promote n6 → retire
  another). Proposals bounced by the gate/one-in-flight rule are retried
  next round; the linearizability oracle runs after every round. The run
  completes the plan through at least the second add, keeps committing
  writes, and compacts throughout.

### Next

- **I7 is complete.** Next is **I8 — Raft-backed KV in the control plane**
  (§17 task 6), which begins with the plan's **MANDATORY stop-and-ask**:
  propose to the owner exactly what replicates through Raft before writing
  any code.

## I8 — the stop-and-ask, resolved (§17 task 6)

- **Date:** 2026-07-09
- **The owner decided** (per the plan's mandatory ask, options + recommendation
  presented and the recommended cut chosen on both):
  1. **What replicates:** action-cache writes and cluster-level configuration.
     **Not** CAS blob bytes (Phase 3 quorum replication owns blob durability)
     and **not** scheduler queue / worker registry / leases (ephemeral by ADR
     design — workers re-register and leases reassign on failover). The I9
     failover story is therefore: builds keep their cache, in-flight jobs
     re-run.
  2. **Reads:** implement **ReadIndex** — the leader confirms leadership with
     a heartbeat round before serving at its commit index. Linearizable reads,
     the textbook mechanism, small now that heartbeats exist.
- **Split:** I8a = the `MetaKv` seam (control-plane refactor, no Raft);
  I8b = the state-machine apply loop + ReadIndex in `brokkr-raft`;
  I8c = `RaftKv` + follower `NotLeader` redirect + 3-node failover tests +
  the `--raft` flag (off ⇒ exactly today's behavior).

## I8a — the `MetaKv` seam (§17 task 6)

- **Date:** 2026-07-09
- **Affected:** `crates/brokkr-control` (`metakv.rs` new; `lib.rs`, `main.rs`).
- **Outcome:** everything the owner chose to replicate now flows through one
  trait. `MetaKv` (get/put/delete/scan_prefix over `Bytes`) with the
  single-node `RedbMetaKv` impl; `MetaKvActionCache<K>` adapts any `MetaKv`
  to the REAPI `ActionCache` trait, and `main` wires the scheduler and the
  `ActionCacheService` through it. Zero behavior change.

### Decisions / notes

- **Namespaced keys in one table** (`ac/<digest-hash>`; cluster config claims
  its own prefix in I8c): one KV instance carries every replicated namespace,
  `scan_prefix` recovers a namespace wholesale, and the I8c snapshot is one
  serialized table.
- **The consumers never see the seam.** Scheduler and service take
  `Arc<dyn ActionCache>` already; only `main`'s wiring changed. Swapping
  `RedbMetaKv` for `RaftKv` in I8c is a one-line change at the same spot.
- **`NotLeader` is deliberately NOT pre-declared.** The review pass showed
  that declaring it alongside a catch-all `From<MetaKvError> for CasError`
  wires the wrong default: the structured leader hint would flatten into a
  storage-error string and the I8c redirect would silently ship broken. The
  conversion is instead an exhaustive match — when I8c adds the variant, the
  compile breaks right there until the redirect (gRPC `FAILED_PRECONDITION`
  + leader hint in metadata) gets a real propagation path.
- **Storage location changes** from `action_cache.redb` (table
  `action_results`) to `meta.redb` (table `meta_kv`). Existing cached action
  results are not migrated — it is a cache; it refills. `RedbActionCache`
  stays in `brokkr-cas` for its other users.
- **The contract suite is reusable:** `metakv_contract_suite<K: MetaKv>` is
  `pub(crate)` in the test module; I8c runs the same suite against `RaftKv`,
  which is the plan's "contract suite runs against both impls" requirement.

### Next

- **I8b:** the `StateMachine` apply loop in the `brokkr-raft` driver
  (apply committed entries / snapshot / restore — the hooks I6 left for
  "the shell") and **ReadIndex** in the core (leadership confirmation
  round, read served at the confirmed commit index once applied).
