//! Multi-worker scheduling primitives (ADR 0008): the connected-worker
//! registry and the pluggable worker-selection [`Strategy`].
//!
//! This module is the data-model foundation for §16 task 3. The scheduler
//! wiring that routes jobs through it is a separate increment; keeping the
//! policy (`Strategy`) and the connection state (`ConnectedWorkers`) here —
//! both proto-light and free of dispatch plumbing — makes them unit-testable
//! in isolation.
