//! Job scheduler: bridges the REAPI `Execute` RPC (client-facing) to the
//! internal `brokkr.v1.WorkerService.Stream` (worker-facing).
//!
//! Multi-worker dispatch follows ADR 0008: each connected worker has its own
//! job channel ([`crate::scheduling::ConnectedWorkers`]); `execute` filters to
//! the eligible (matching + connected) workers and a pluggable
//! [`crate::scheduling::Strategy`] picks one. Global queueing, leases, and fair
//! scheduling are Phase 4 task 4.
