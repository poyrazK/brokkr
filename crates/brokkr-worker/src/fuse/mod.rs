//! FUSE-backed lazy input materialisation for the worker (Phase 3 M6b).
//!
//! See `docs/phase-3-plan.md` §5.5 + §5.5.1 for the design. The
//! short story: instead of copying a multi-GiB Bazel input tree to
//! the workspace before every action (the M6a `materialize_tree`
//! path), the worker exposes the tree as a FUSE mount. `getattr` /
//! `lookup` / `readdir` are served from an in-memory inode table
//! built from the `Directory` Merkle DAG; file content is fetched
//! from CAS only on the first `read(2)` and cached locally for the
//! lifetime of the action.
//!
//! ## Module layout
//!
//! * [`inode`]: pure data + DAG-walking builder. Platform-independent
//!   and fully unit-testable without `/dev/fuse`.
//! * [`mount`] (Linux only): the `fuser::Filesystem` implementation,
//!   the [`mount::InputMount`] RAII handle, and the public
//!   [`mount::mount`] entry point. Compiles to a stub on non-Linux
//!   that always returns a [`mount::MountError`].
//!
//! ## Lifetime
//!
//! One mount per running action. The worker:
//!
//! 1. Builds an [`mount::InputMountSpec`] from the action's input
//!    root digest and a job-scoped scratch directory.
//! 2. Calls [`mount::mount`] (async — pre-walks the DAG).
//! 3. Adds the mountpoint to the sandbox's `ro_binds`.
//! 4. Runs the action.
//! 5. Drops the [`mount::InputMount`] handle — unmount + cache
//!    cleanup happen synchronously in `Drop`.
