//! From-scratch Raft consensus for the Brokkr control plane.
//!
//! `brokkr-raft` implements the Raft algorithm (Ongaro & Ousterhout, 2014) by
//! hand — no external Raft crate (CLAUDE.md rule 10). The design is fixed by
//! [ADR 0013](../../../docs/architecture/0013-custom-raft.md) and the spec in
//! `docs/raft-notes.md`.
//!
//! This crate is being built incrementally across Phase 5 milestones I1–I9.
//! The current scaffold (I1) provides the foundational pieces the consensus
//! state machine is built on:
//!
//! - [`types`] — the [`Term`], [`LogIndex`], and [`NodeId`] newtypes plus
//!   [`LogEntry`], with lossless conversions to/from the wire protobuf.
//! - [`error`] — the [`RaftError`] typed error enum.
//! - [`rng`] — a small deterministic, seeded PRNG ([`Rng`]) for election-timeout
//!   jitter (ADR 0013 D3: no external dependency, reproducible under simulation).
//! - [`state`] — the [`HardState`] (`currentTerm` + `votedFor`) that must be
//!   persisted atomically before responding to an RPC (`docs/raft-notes.md` §3).
//! - [`storage`] — the redb-backed [`RaftLog`], persisting the replicated log
//!   and hard state (ADR 0013 D1) with atomic, persist-before-respond writes
//!   (crash-consistency proven by the I2 tests).
//! - [`transport`] — the async [`Transport`] trait and its request/reply types,
//!   with a production [`TonicTransport`] and an in-process
//!   [`InMemoryTransport`] for deterministic tests (ADR 0013 D2).
//! - [`node`] — the [`RaftNode`] consensus state machine. Milestone I3
//!   implements **leader election** (`RequestVote`, the election restriction,
//!   randomized timeouts, heartbeat suppression); milestone I4 adds **log
//!   replication**: the `AppendEntries` consistency check with conflict-only
//!   truncation, per-peer `nextIndex`/`matchIndex` back-off, a client `propose`,
//!   and the current-term commit rule (the **Figure-8** safety property).
//!
//! [`RaftNode`] is a synchronous, single-owner state machine (no locks, ADR 0013
//! D4): callers drive it with `tick` (time), `handle_*` (RPCs), and `propose`
//! (client writes), and it returns the messages to send. The async event-loop
//! shell that wires it to a [`Transport`] and a real clock is [`RaftDriver`]
//! (I5).
//!
//! Milestone I6 adds **snapshots and log compaction** (Raft §7): the committed
//! prefix compacts into a [`SnapshotMeta`] + opaque blob (atomically with the
//! prefix drop), a leader ships `InstallSnapshot` to followers whose entries
//! were compacted away, and recovery floors the commit index at the snapshot.
